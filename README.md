I'll try my best to explain the workings:

It's parametric-automated functional around controlled sequence RNG method with proven biochem relevant numericals deliberating dynamic modification to volume and speed. In other words, the general idea to advance song along fluctuations to volume and speed defined along a special number preset interval pattern with RNG functionality alongside key amplitude breakpoints applied to deciding extent of volume or tempo modification.

So, from code background, in my best working config

advance protocol for volume:

[4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]

advance protocol for tempo:

[2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2]

Multiplier on advance protocol applied duration: .25, so scaling 2*.25 gives min interval of .50 seconds

RNG-able values for volume: [.4, .45, .5, .55, .6]

RNG-able values for tempo: [.8, .9, 1, 1.1, 1.2]

Some neuroscience clippings [THE BRIEF: music interfaces with regions of brain mediating components of cognitive function, tempo factors]:
Effects of Musical Tempo on Musicians’ and Non-musicians’ Emotional Experience When Listening to Music https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6243583/

Medium music activated right HG, MTG, cingulate gyrus, precuneus, IPL, and left STG. "precuneus is a brain region involved in a variety of complex functions,100 which include recollection and memory, integration of information (gestalt) relating to perception of the environment, cue reactivity, mental imagery strategies, episodic memory retrieval, and affective responses to pain"

"The IPL can function in cognitive control with regulating working memory and taking part in observing others’ activities, understanding relevant intentions before beginning subsequent acts with a top-down process (Fogassi et al., 2005). Conversely, we found that the IPL was engaged in responding to emotional information. While viewing emotional images, activation of the IPL has been recognized to arouse the emotions (Ochsner et al., 2012; Ferri et al., 2016). In an emotion-detecting experiment, Engelen et al. (2015) presented neutral and emotional body conditions of equaled motion; they found stronger activation of the IPL in the emotional condition in contrast to a neutral body gesture. The left IPL plays a pivotal role in many cognitive functions (Bzdok et al., 2016), such as second language learning (Sliwinska, 2015; Barbeau et al., 2017), semantic processing (Patel, 2003; Donnay et al., 2014), auditory working memory (Alain et al., 2008), and implicit processing of brief musical emotions (Bogert et al., 2016). In the magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording of cortical entrainment to music and its modulation by expertise, left lateralization was confirmed in a topographical analysis of the difference between musicians and non-musicians in the beta range (Doelling and Poeppel, 2015). Combined with the higher valence of musicians to non-musicians, the stronger activation of the IPL could be important evidence of superior processing for musicians’ emotional experience."

"the posterior cingulate gyrus regions had only moderate positive correlations with full-scale intelligence scores"

"The theory is that hyperfocus and flow state cause music to be perceived as slower."

"Musical tempo affects EEG spectral dynamics during subsequent time estimation"

Music changes tonic EEG that subsequently affects EEG dynamics during time estimation.

The fastest music induced a beta power increase that affected timing.

Music at 90 and 120 bpm modulated alpha dynamics during time estimation.

Music at 120 bpm produced higher time estimation accuracy.
